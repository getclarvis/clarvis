# Repository tooling

This directory owns automation that applies to the Clarvis repository as a whole. Package-specific
automation stays under that package's `tooling/` directory; for example, `@clarvis/code` owns its
artifact builders and performance benchmarks in `packages/code/tooling/`.

| Directory             | Ownership                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `checks/`             | Executable repository policy and consistency checks                           |
| `lib/`                | Importable implementation shared by checks and their tests                    |
| `test-runtime/`       | Process setup loaded by Bun before repository tests                           |
| `tests/unit/`         | Focused checker and library behavior                                          |
| `tests/architecture/` | Cross-file repository invariants                                              |
| `ci/`                 | CI-only orchestration that cannot be expressed as a portable TypeScript check |

Root tooling is TypeScript unless a shell is the behavior under test or the workflow itself requires
shell control flow. It participates in `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint:eslint`,
`bun run format:check`, `bun run knip`, and the supported root `bun run test` command.

`lib/package-architecture.ts` is the single machine-readable role registry and dependency-direction
policy for all workspace packages. It also owns the single-version product rule: root
`package.json` is authoritative, workspace manifests and lock entries are unversioned, workspaces
are private, and runtime reads of the root manifest are allowlisted. `lib/package-graph.ts` applies
these policies to manifest and source edges, and `checks/package-graph.ts` verifies the generated
role table and diagram committed in
[`../specs/package-coupling-analysis.md`](../specs/package-coupling-analysis.md).

`ci/retry-code-coverage.sh` is intentionally isolated as a temporary crash retry. It remains until a
Bun 1.4 GitHub-runner canary records at least 30 successful `@clarvis/code` coverage runs with none
of the historical signal exits. Its evidence and retirement condition live in
[`../specs/known-issues.md`](../specs/known-issues.md#bun-dies-by-signal-in-the-clarviscode-suite).
